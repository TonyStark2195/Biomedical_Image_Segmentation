# Biomedical Image Segmentation

Tumor Cell localization using Capsule Networks &amp; U-Net:
- Implemented Segmentation Capsule Networks and U-Net from scratch in PyTorch for image segmentation of tumours and cancer cells on CT/MRI images (4-dimensional) of Brain and Hepatic vessels
- Development of the Routing by agreement algorithm and custom Loss functions like Dice and AJI
- Building a complete ML pipeline; Data retrieval and processing with PyMongo and PyTorch; Model training, Hyper-parameter tuning, Cross-Fold Validation, and automatic selection of best model with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn; Version control and containerizing with Git and Docker; Result Visualization and Logging using TensorBoard


Python Packages used: **PyTorch, torchvision, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorBoard, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, PyMongo, PIL, nibabel, OpenCV, ipython widgets** 
\
Other technologies involved: **Git, Docker, Linux servers, Google CoLab, GPU, Latex**
